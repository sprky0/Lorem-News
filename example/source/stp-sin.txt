Holywater clouds my thinking
Sinking low now
Keep on drinking

Down you go, suffer long
Down you go, sin make me strong
Down you go, suffer long
Down you go, sin make me strong

You control me, soul you stole, mine
Wishful thinking
Six feet under

Down you go, suffer long
Down you go, sin make me strong
Down you go, suffer long
Down you go, sin make me strong

Dead by dreaming, sleep you steal, mine
Pools of cold sweat
Hatred burns me

Down you go, suffer long
Down you go, sin make me strong
Down you go, suffer long
Down you go, sin make me strong

Still shackled to the shadow
Still shackled to the shadow
That followed you...
Still shackled to the shadow
Still shackled to the shadow
That followed you...
Still shackled to the shadow
Still shackled to the shadow
That followed you...
