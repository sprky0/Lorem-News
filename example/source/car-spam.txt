The Chubb Group of Insurance Companies has produced an instructional video on preparing collector cars for driving after the winter’s hibernation. The video features two Chubb employees, who also are car enthusiasts, providing step-by-step instructions on how to ensure that cars that have been kept in storage during the winter are ready for the road again.

Any automobile that has been dormant for a month or more requires special attention before it is driven again. The video shows viewers how to replace the engine coolant; check the battery, lights and lug nuts; and search for fluid leaks and rodent damage, among other things.

“We have tapped into our expertise as a provider of classic car insurance for more than 40 years to produce this video,” said Jim Fiske, U.S. marketing manager for Chubb Personal Insurance. “Although we produced the video with the novice collector car owner in mind, more experienced car enthusiasts may appreciate some helpful reminders.”

This video is the first in a series of collector car videos that Chubb will produce this year. Other topics include preparing a collector car for a show or winter storage.

In the early 1930s, the Alfa 2.3 straight eight, supercharged, twin overhead cam was state of the art with 150 horsepower and one of the few vehicles truly capable of reaching 100 MPH at the time. This 8C has a remarkable racing history, winning the Mille Miglia in 1932 and 1933, the Le Mans in 1932-34 and the Spa 24 Hour Race in 1932. 

This extremely rare car is further unique due to the fact that the running boards and the front and rear wings all blend together, and it is one of the only 2.3 Alfa Romeo’s in existence with its original coachwork still intact.

Sponsored by AC Delco, “Car E.R.” follows Pam, Peter (her long time fiancé) and the rest of the gang at Pam’s Motor City as they deal with tricky automotive repairs, esoteric customers, and serious attitudes within the shop. Of course, not everything’s a problem, and there’s a lot of fun and good times, too.

Unique to this series is that Pam owns and operates the repair shop, day in and day out. Not many women dare to venture into this highly male oriented field of work, but Pam follows in her father’s footsteps, and gives the boys a run for their money. They better pay attention when she talks, because she owns the shop!

The series is slated for first-run distribution via the internet, with future television broadcasts on the horizon. Initial reviews are that “Car E.R.” is sure to be a hit, and the potential for being picked up by a feature network is high.
